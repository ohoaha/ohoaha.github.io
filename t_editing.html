        <h3>editing</h3>
        <p>Editing is the process of combining disparate shots together to create
             relationships between them. Editing is essential to stitch shots together
              to construct the narrative time and space. Some forms of editing are
              discreet, while others more obvious.</p>

        <h4 id="de">Devices</h4>
        <h5>Transitions</h5>
        <h6>cheat cuts</h6>
          <p>A cheat cut is a type of continuity editting that purports to show continuous time and space from
            one shot to the next, but actually mismatches the positions of figures or objects in the scene.
            Cheat cuts were often employed to disguise the difference in the heights of shorter leading men and
            tall leading ladies.
         </p>
        <p>In the following series of stills from
          <span class="movie">Shadow Of A Doubt (1943)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>, the extreme close-up of female
          protagonist’s hands holding the ring reveals the crucial writing inside the ring. But it does not
          match up with how she is holding the ring in the shots before and after this shot.
        </p>

          <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aEZQPWU.png">

          <h6>crosscutting</h6>
          <p>Crosscutting, also called parallel editing, alternates between shots from two or more lines of
            action occurring in different diegetic spaces, simultaneously. In most but not all cases, the lines
            of action are occuring at the same time. Crosscutting is used to connect the two events that are
            occurring and the characters therein.
          </p>
          <p>In this clip from
            <span class="movie">Snatch (2000)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>, crosscutting is used to draw parallels between the coursing and
            Tyrone (Ade) being chased by two thugs, likening him to the hare and his pursuers to the greyhounds.
          </p>

          picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          <h6>cut-in and cut-away</h6>
          <p>A cut-in happens when we instantaneously shift from a distant view to a closer one, and vice-versa.
            In this scene from
            <span class="movie">A Man Called Ove (2015)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>, a distant shot shows us the erratic driving of the car
            that others on the street see, while a cut-in reveals Parvaneh (Bahar Pars) in the car struggling
            to drive correctly under Ove’s (Rolf Lassgård) supervision.
          </p>

          <img src="https://i.imgur.com/sEc4EEa.png">

          <h6>dissolve</h6>
          <p>A dissolve is a transition from one shot to another brought about by fading out the first shot and
            fading in the next, such that for a moment the two shots are superimposed on each other. Dissolves
            can be used simply as a transitional element, or in more creative ways, such as to denote
            hallucinatory states or the passage of time.
          </p>
          <p> Dissolves are used in this sequence from
            <span class="movie">The Shawshank Redemption (1994)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span> as the character looks
            for a tree and a package buried underneath it.</p>
          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g2D-Sqltav4"
           frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
           picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          <h6>Iris</h6>
          <p>An iris is a round, moving mask that closes in to end a scene or focus on a detail (iris-in),  or
            open out to reveal a scene or more space around a detail (iris-out).
           </p>
           <p>At the beginning of
             <span class="movie">Shock Corridor (1963)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>, an iris-out is used to reveal to the audience the
             eponymous corridor, with the protagonist introducing himself in the voice over.
          </p>
          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-z8q8rmBfdA" frameborder="0"
          allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
          </iframe>

          <h6>Establishing Shot/Re-establishing Shot</h6>
          <p>Establishing shots reveal to the audience the setting of a scene, the
             characters therein, and the relationships between them These are typically
             the first few shots of a scene and are taken in extreme long shots or
             long shots.
          </p>
          <p> The audience is introduced to the dry and hot Texas environs
          in some beautiful long shots at the very beginning of
          <span class="movie">No Country For Old Men (2007)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>,
          hence establishing the diegetic place of the film.
          </p>
          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vsgk5vm3lls"
             frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
             picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          <h6>Shot/Reverse Shot</h6>
          <p>In this form of editing, multiple scenes are edited together such
            that they show characters alternately, typically to show them and their
            reactions in a conversation situation. Shots such as over-the-shoulder
            shots, angled shots, and left/right alternating shots can be used to
            achieve shot/reverse shots.
          </p>
          <p> One example among many is illustrated by
          the following stills from
          <span class="movie">Léon: The Professional (1994)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span> which show Léon
          (Jean Reno) conversing with Mathilda (Natalie Portman).
          </p>
          <img src="https://i.imgur.com/m4rJO3B.png">
          <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xoxNebA.png">

          <h6>Superimposition</h6>
          <p>Superimpositions are achieved by exposing multiple images on the same
             film strip. Superimpositions are not used for transitions (as in the
             dissolve) but for other creative purposes: to show the same actor playing
            two characters in the same frame, to express subjective or intoxicated
            vision, or to introduce other diegetic elements to the screen. </p>

            <p>In this (yet another!) example from
              <span class="movie">Citizen Kane (1941)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>, newspaper
              headlines are superimposed on images of Kane’s wife performing to
              demonstrate the burgeoning ‘success’ of her singing career.
            </p>

            picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          <h5>Matches</h5>
          <p>Match editing, a major element of continuity editing, is used to draw
            connections between elements in subsequent shots. The connections are
            implied by the situation portrayed in the scene. When done well, match
            editing can produce a seamless cinematic experience.</p>

          <h6>Eyeline Match</h6>
          <p>In eyeline matches, the shots are edited such that the first shot shows
            a character looking at something, and the second cuts to what the character
            is looking at.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="movie">Cinema Paradiso (1988)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span> contains many shots of cinema-goers
          eyeline matched with shots of the screen, to show what they are attentively
          watching.</p>
          <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZPKmZR4.png">
          <img src="https://i.imgur.com/CalZvCG.png">

          <h6>Graphic Match</h6>
          <p>Graphic matching uses a similarity in some compositional element
            (like shape or colour) to achieve a smooth transition between two shots.
            Such matching can connect two otherwise disconnected scenes, or establish
            a relationship between two scenes.</p>
          <p>This clip from
            <span class="movie">Psycho (1960)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>, showing an example of a graphic match,
            takes place right after Marion (Janet Leigh) has been stabbed in the shower.
            As the blood is washed away with the water, the camera focuses on the
            circular bathtub drain, which is then matched with her lifeless eye in
            the next shot.</p>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ydcWYYfciw"
            frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
            picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          <h6>Match on Action</h6>
          <p>A match on action edit cuts alternate views of the same action together
             at the same moment in order to make it seem uninterrupted. This allows
            the same action to be seen from multiple angles without breaking its
            continuous nature.
          </p>
          <p>In this clip from
            <span class="movie">Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>, match
          on action editing provides a dynamic view of the fierce sword-fight
          between the Bride (Uma Thurman) and her adversary.</p>
          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0cALghSaKf8"
            frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
             picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          <h5>Duration</h5>
          <h6>Long Take</h6>
          <p>A long take, like the name suggests, is a shot that lasts longer than
            usual. Modern films have very small shot lengths, so any shot that lasts
            for more than a minute is generally considered a long take. These are
            usually taken with a moving camera and require choreography and rehearsal
            to get right.
          </p>
          <p>The famous Copacabana shot in
            <span class="movie">Goodfellas (1990)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span> is a long shot that follows Henry
          (Ray Liotta) and his wife as he bypasses the regular entrance and leads
          her on an alternate path through the back kitchens in an assured, confident way.</p>
          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2AYTSY6VkzE"
          frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
          picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          <h6>Rhythm</h6>
          <p>Rhythm refers to the perceived rate and regularity of sounds, series of shots, and movements
            within the shots. The rhythm of a film is influenced by beat (or pulse), accent (or stress), tempo
            (or pace) etc. It is a combination of mise-en-scène, cinematography, sound, and editing, all of
            which contribute to the overall mood and effect of the film.</p>

          <p>The prelude to the final showdown of
            <span class="movie">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span> runs for several
            minutes, as three men face each other in a triangle, waiting to see who will take the first step.
            One of the film’s theme songs is played in its entirety, from a slow, elegiac beginning to a frenzy
            crescendo that is abruptly cut off by the first gunshot. The slow mounting crescendo is paralleled
            by an increase in the editing rate.
          </p>

          <h4 id="st">Styles</h4>
          <p>The patterned use of transitions, matches, and durations can give rise
             to identifiable editing styles which can be associated with technological
             developments, historical moments, and national schools.
          </p>
          <h5>Continuity Style</h5>
          <p>Continuity editing seeks to maintain clear and consistent narrative structure by matching screen
            direction, position, and temporal relations from shot to shot. It maintains the viewer’s assumption
            that space and time are contiguous between successive shots. This is done by adhering to the “180॰
            rule”, which is illustrated below. According to this rule, the camera must always remain on one side
            of the “axis of action”, i.e. an imaginary line drawn connecting the two major elements, usually the
            actors.</p>

            <p>The “180॰ rule” ensures that characters on screen occupy consistent positions on the screen,
              aiding the audience in understanding the layout of the scene. This is observed in the following
              scene from
              <span class="movie">The Godfather: Part II (1974)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>.

            <h5>Elliptical Style</h5>
            <p>	In the elliptical editing style, subsequent shots omit parts of
              time, causing ellipses in the plot and diegetic time. One form of
              editing special to elliptical editing is the jump cut. The jump cut
              emphasises the constructed nature of film, which is opposite to the
              continuity style.

              jump cuts show

               with the female protagonist.</p>
